"This was an exemple of managing Compliance of unprotected organisation for their data and users and evaluate risks and threats to make a better security posture."

Botium Toys is a small American company that develops and sells toys. The company has a single physical location, which serves as its main office, storefront, and warehouse for its products. However, Botium Toy's online presence has grown, attracting customers in the United States and abroad. As a result, the IT department's authentication server is under increasing pressure to support the online marketplace worldwide.

The IT manager has decided that an internal IT audit should be performed. She is concerned about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes that an internal audit can help better secure the company's infrastructure and help identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager also wants to ensure that the company is complying with regulations regarding internal processing and acceptance of online payments, as well as conducting business in the European Union (EU).

The IT manager begins by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and objectives, listing the assets currently managed by the IT department, and conducting a risk assessment. The purpose of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or penalties that the organization could incur due to the current state of its security posture.

My task is to review the IT manager's scope, objectives, and risk assessment report. Next, I will conduct an internal audit by completing a checklist and compliance.
